Progress\r\nQA systems have been extended in recent years to encompass additional domains of knowledge[10] For example, systems have been developed to automatically answer temporal and geospatial questions, questions of definition and terminology, biographical questions, multilingual questions, and questions about the content of audio, images, and video. Current QA research topics include:\r\n\r\ninteractivity\u2014clarification of questions or answers\r\nanswer reuse or caching\r\nanswer presentation[11]\r\nknowledge representation and reasoning\r\nsocial media analysis with QA systems\r\nsentiment analysis[12]\r\nutilization of thematic roles[13]\r\nsemantic resolution: to bridge the gap between syntactically different questions and answer-bearing texts[14]\r\nutilization of linguistic resources,[15] such as WordNet, FrameNet, and the similar\r\nIBM's question answering system, Watson, defeated the two greatest Jeopardy! champions, Brad Rutter and Ken Jennings, by a significant margin.
