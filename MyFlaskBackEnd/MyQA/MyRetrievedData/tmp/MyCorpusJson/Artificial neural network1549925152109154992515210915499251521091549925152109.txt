An artificial neuron mimics the working of a biophysical neuron with inputs and outputs, but is not a biological neuron model. The network forms by connecting the output of certain neurons to the input of other neurons forming a directed, weighted graph. The weights as well as the functions that compute the activation can be modified by a process called learning which is governed by a learning rule. [52]\r\n\r\nComponents of an artificial neural network\r\nNeurons\r\nA neuron with label {\\displaystyle j} j receiving an input {\\displaystyle p_{j}(t)} {\\displaystyle p_{j}(t)} from predecessor neurons consists of the following components:[52]\r\n\r\nan activation {\\displaystyle a_{j}(t)} {\\displaystyle a_{j}(t)}, the neuron's state, depending on a discrete time parameter,\r\npossibly a threshold {\\displaystyle \\theta _{j}} \\theta _{j}, which stays fixed unless changed by a learning function,\r\nan activation function {\\displaystyle f} f that computes the new activation at a given time {\\displaystyle t+1} t+1 from {\\displaystyle a_{j}(t)} {\\displaystyle a_{j}(t)}, {\\displaystyle \\theta _{j}} \\theta _{j} and the net input {\\displaystyle p_{j}(t)} {\\displaystyle p_{j}(t)} giving rise to the relation\r\n{\\displaystyle a_{j}(t+1)=f(a_{j}(t),p_{j}(t),\\theta _{j})} {\\displaystyle a_{j}(t+1)=f(a_{j}(t),p_{j}(t),\\theta _{j})},\r\nand an output function {\\displaystyle f_{out}} {\\displaystyle f_{out}} computing the output from the activation\r\n{\\displaystyle o_{j}(t)=f_{out}(a_{j}(t))} {\\displaystyle o_{j}(t)=f_{out}(a_{j}(t))}. Often the output function is simply the Identity function. An input neuron has no predecessor but serves as input interface for the whole network. Similarly an output neuron has no successor and thus serves as output interface of the whole network. Connections, weights and biases\r\nThe network consists of connections, each connection transferring the output of a neuron {\\displaystyle i} i to the input of a neuron {\\displaystyle j} j. In this sense {\\displaystyle i} i is the predecessor of {\\displaystyle j} j and {\\displaystyle j} j is the successor of {\\displaystyle i} i. "}
