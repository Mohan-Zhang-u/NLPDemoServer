{"id": "How is computational linguistics different from natural language processing1549927015317.txt", "text": "If you want to truly advance either field in a lasting way, you should develop enough strength to do original research in all three of these areas. It might help to go to a school with a strong interdisciplinary culture, where many of the CS faculty and students are actively interested in linguistics for its own sake (or vice-versa). That said, NLP people often get away with relatively superficial linguistics. They look at the errors made by their current system, and learn only as much linguistics as they need to understand and fix the most prominent types of errors. After all, their goal is not a full theory but rather the simplest, most efficient approach that will get the job done. Conversely, if you study computational linguistics in a linguistics department, you will typically get a lot more linguistics and a lot less CS/ML. The students in those departments are technically adept, since linguistics is quite a technical field. But they tend to know much less math and CS. So the computational courses tend to be providing only some exposure to formal language theory, programming, and applied NLP. (These courses are popular among linguistics students who hope to improve their employability.) Eventually I hope the two research programs will draw even closer together. If we can build a strong model of the human linguistic capacity, then that should solve a wide range of NLP problems for us. So today's computational linguistics is developing methods for tomorrow's NLP. That's been historically true too. "}
