[36]\r\n\r\nComputational linguistics can be especially helpful in situations involving social media and the Internet. For example, filters in chatrooms or on website searches require computational linguistics. Chat operators often use filters to identify certain words or phrases and deem them inappropriate so that users cannot submit them. [36] Another example of using filters is on websites. Schools use filters so that websites with certain keywords are blocked from children to view. There are also many programs in which parents use Parental controls to put content filters in place. Computational linguists can also develop programs that group and organize content through Social media mining. An example of this is Twitter, in which programs can group tweets by subject or keywords. [37] Computational linguistics is also used for document retrieval and clustering. When you do an online search, documents and websites are retrieved based on the frequency of unique labels related to what you typed into a search engine. For instance, if you search \"red, large, four-wheeled vehicle,\" with the intention of finding pictures of a red truck, the search engine will still find the information desired by matching words such as \"four-wheeled\" with \"car\". [38]\r\n\r\nSubfields\r\nComputational linguistics can be divided into major areas depending upon the medium of the language being processed, whether spoken or textual; and upon the task being performed, whether analyzing language (recognition) or synthesizing language (generation). Speech recognition and speech synthesis deal with how spoken language can be understood or created using computers. Parsing and generation are sub-divisions of computational linguistics dealing respectively with taking language apart and putting it together. Machine translation remains the sub-division of computational linguistics dealing with having computers translate between languages. The possibility of automatic language translation, however, has yet to be realized and remains a notoriously hard branch of computational linguistics. [39]\r\n\r\nSome of the areas of research that are studied by computational linguistics include:\r\n\r\nComputational complexity of natural language, largely modeled on automata theory, with the application of context-sensitive grammar and linearly bounded Turing machines. Computational semantics comprises defining suitable logics for linguistic meaning representation, automatically constructing them and reasoning with them\r\nComputer-aided corpus linguistics, which has been used since the 1970s as a way to make detailed advances in the field of discourse analysis[40]\r\nDesign of parsers or chunkers for natural languages\r\nDesign of taggers like POS-taggers (part-of-speech taggers)\r\nMachine translation as one of the earliest and most difficult applications of computational linguistics draws on many subfields. Simulation and study of language evolution in historical linguistics/glottochronology. Legacy\r\nThe subject of computational linguistics has had a recurring impact on popular culture:\r\n\r\nThe 1983 film WarGames features a young computer hacker who interacts with an artificially intelligent supercomputer. [41]\r\nA 1997 film, Conceiving Ada, focuses on Ada Lovelace, considered one of the first computer scientists, as well as themes of computational linguistics. "}
