Learning can be supervised, semi-supervised or unsupervised. [1][2][3]\r\n\r\nDeep learning architectures such as deep neural networks, deep belief networks and recurrent neural networks have been applied to fields including computer vision, speech recognition, natural language processing, audio recognition, social network filtering, machine translation, bioinformatics, drug design, medical image analysis, material inspection and board game programs, where they have produced results comparable to and in some cases superior to human experts. [4][5][6]\r\n\r\nDeep learning models are vaguely inspired by information processing and communication patterns in biological nervous systems yet have various differences from the structural and functional properties of biological brains (especially human brains), which make them incompatible with neuroscience evidences.

Each successive layer uses the output from the previous layer as input. learn in supervised (e.g., classification) and/or unsupervised (e.g., pattern analysis) manners. learn multiple levels of representations that correspond to different levels of abstraction; the levels form a hierarchy of concepts. Overview\r\nMost modern deep learning models are based on an artificial neural network, although they can also include propositional formulas or latent variables organized layer-wise in deep generative models such as the nodes in deep belief networks and deep Boltzmann machines. [11]\r\n\r\nIn deep learning, each level learns to transform its input data into a slightly more abstract and composite representation. In an image recognition application, the raw input may be a matrix of pixels; the first representational layer may abstract the pixels and encode edges; the second layer may compose and encode arrangements of edges; the third layer may encode a nose and eyes; and the fourth layer may recognize that the image contains a face.
