{"id": "2.txt", "text": "Mother Love Bone was an American rock band that formed in Seattle, Washington in 1987. The band was active from 1987 to 1990. Frontman Andrew Wood\u2019s personality and compositions helped to catapult the group to the top of the burgeoning late 1980s/early 1990s Seattle music scene. Wood died only days be- fore the scheduled release of the band\u2019s debut album, \u201cApple\u201d, thus ending the group\u2019s hopes of success. The album was finally released a few months later.
