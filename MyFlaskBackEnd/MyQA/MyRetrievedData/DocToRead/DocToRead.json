{"data": [{"title": "", "paragraphs": [{"context": "Dota 2 is a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) video game developed and published by Valve Corporation. The game is a sequel to Defense of the Ancients (DotA), which was a community-created mod for Blizzard Entertainment\\'s Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos and its expansion pack, The Frozen Throne. Dota 2 is played in matches between two teams of five players, with each team occupying and defending their own separate base on the map. Each of the ten players independently controls a powerful character, known as a \\\"hero\\\", who all have unique abilities and differing styles of play. During a match, players collect experience points and items for their heroes to successfully defeat the opposing team\\'s heroes in player versus player combat. A team wins by being the first to destroy a large structure located in the opposing team\\'s base, called the \\\"Ancient\\\". Development of Dota 2 began in 2009 when IceFrog, lead designer of the original Defense of the Ancients mod, was hired by Valve to create a modernized remake in the Source game engine. It was officially released for Microsoft Windows, OS X, and Linux-based personal computers via the digital distribution platform Steam in July 2013, following a Windows-only public beta phase that began two years prior. As the game is fully free-to-play with no heroes needing to be bought or unlocked, revenue is made from microtransactions, specifically loot boxes, battle passes, and a monthly-based subscription system called Dota Plus, which all offer non-gameplay altering virtual goods, such as cosmetic hero armor and weapon replacements, in return. The game has also been updated with various other features since release, such as support for virtual reality (VR) and a full transition to the Source 2 engine in 2015. Despite some criticism going towards its steep learning curve and complexity, Dota 2 was praised for its rewarding gameplay, production quality, and faithfulness to its predecessor, with multiple gaming publications later considering it to be one of the greatest video games of all time. Since its release, it has been one of the most played games on Steam, with over a million concurrent players at its peak. The popularity of the game has led to official merchandise for it being produced, including apparel, accessories, and toys, as well as promotional tie-ins to other games and media. The game also allows for the community to create custom game modes, maps, and hero cosmetics, which are uploaded to the Steam Workshop and curated by Valve. A digital collectible card game by Valve based on Dota 2, titled Artifact, will be released in November 2018. Dota 2 has a widespread and active competitive scene, with teams from across the world playing professionally in various leagues and tournaments. Premium tournaments featuring the game often have prize pools totaling millions of U.S. dollars, the highest of any eSport. The largest of them is known as The International, which is produced annually by Valve and most commonly held at the KeyArena in Seattle. Valve also manages an event format known as the Dota Pro Circuit, which are a series of tournaments held prior to Internationals that award qualification points based on results for getting directly invited to them. \n", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": -1, "text": ""}], "question": "what is dota 2?", "id": 0}]}]}, {"title": "", "paragraphs": [{"context": "For most tournaments, media coverage is done by a selection of on-site staff who provide commentary and analysis for the ongoing matches, similar to traditional sporting events.

The game has also been used in machine learning experiments, with a team of bots known as the OpenAI Five playing against and sometimes defeating professional players. \n", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": -1, "text": ""}], "question": "what is dota 2?", "id": 1}]}]}, {"title": "", "paragraphs": [{"context": "Contents\n1\tHistory\n1.1\tHebbian learning\n1.2\tBackpropagation\n1.3\tHardware-based designs\n1.4\tContests\n1.5\tConvolutional networks\n2\tModels\n2.1\tComponents of an artificial neural network\n2.2\tNeural networks as functions\n2.3\tLearning\n2.4\tLearning paradigms\n2.5\tLearning algorithms\n3\tVariants\n3.1\tGroup method of data handling\n3.2\tConvolutional neural networks\n3.3\tLong short-term memory\n3.4\tDeep reservoir computing\n3.5\tDeep belief networks\n3.6\tLarge memory storage and retrieval neural networks\n3.7\tStacked (de-noising) auto-encoders\n3.8\tDeep stacking networks\n3.9\tTensor deep stacking networks\n3.10\tSpike-and-slab RBMs\n3.11\tCompound hierarchical-deep models\n3.12\tDeep predictive coding networks\n3.13\tNetworks with separate memory structures\n3.14\tMultilayer kernel machine\n4\tNeural architecture search\n5\tUse\n6\tApplications\n6.1\tTypes of models\n7\tTheoretical properties\n7.1\tComputational power\n7.2\tCapacity\n7.3\tConvergence\n7.4\tGeneralization and statistics\n8\tCriticism\n8.1\tTraining issues\n8.2\tTheoretical issues\n8.3\tHardware issues\n8.4\tPractical counterexamples to criticisms\n8.5\tHybrid approaches\n9\tTypes\n10\tGallery\n11\tSee also\n12\tReferences\n13\tBibliography\n14\tExternal links\nHistory\nWarren McCulloch and Walter Pitts[3] (1943) created a computational model for neural networks based on mathematics and algorithms called threshold logic. This model paved the way for neural network research to split into two approaches. One approach focused on biological processes in the brain while the other focused on the application of neural networks to artificial intelligence. This work led to work on nerve networks and their link to finite automata. [4]\n\nHebbian learning\nIn the late 1940s, D. O. Hebb[5] created a learning hypothesis based on the mechanism of neural plasticity that became known as Hebbian learning. Hebbian learning is unsupervised learning. This evolved into models for long term potentiation. Researchers started applying these ideas to computational models in 1948 with Turing\\'s B-type machines. Farley and Clark[6] (1954) first used computational machines, then called \\\"calculators\\\", to simulate a Hebbian network. Other neural network computational machines were created by Rochester, Holland, Habit and Duda (1956). [7]\n\nRosenblatt[8] (1958) created the perceptron, an algorithm for pattern recognition. With mathematical notation, Rosenblatt described circuitry not in the basic perceptron, such as the exclusive-or circuit that could not be processed by neural networks at the time. [9]\n\nIn 1959, a biological model proposed by Nobel laureates Hubel and Wiesel was based on their discovery of two types of cells in the primary visual cortex: simple cells and complex cells. [10]\n\nThe first functional networks with many layers were published by Ivakhnenko and Lapa in 1965, becoming the Group Method of Data Handling. [11][12][13]\n\nNeural network research stagnated after machine learning research by Minsky and Papert (1969),[14] who discovered two key issues with the computational machines that processed neural networks. The first was that basic perceptrons were incapable of processing the exclusive-or circuit. The second was that computers didn\\'t have enough processing power to effectively handle the work required by large neural networks. Neural network research slowed until computers achieved far greater processing power. \n", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": -1, "text": ""}], "question": "what is dota 2?", "id": 2}]}]}], "version": "my_ver"}
