Customer relationship management
Main article: Customer relationship management
Deep reinforcement learning has been used to approximate the value of possible direct marketing actions, defined in terms of RFM variables. The estimated value function was shown to have a natural interpretation as customer lifetime value. [155]

Recommendation systems
Main article: Recommender system
Recommendation systems have used deep learning to extract meaningful features for a latent factor model for content-based music recommendations. [156] Multiview deep learning has been applied for learning user preferences from multiple domains. [157] The model uses a hybrid collaborative and content-based approach and enhances recommendations in multiple tasks. Bioinformatics
Main article: Bioinformatics
An autoencoder ANN was used in bioinformatics, to predict gene ontology annotations and gene-function relationships. [158]

In medical informatics, deep learning was used to predict sleep quality based on data from wearables[159] and predictions of health complications from electronic health record data. [160] Deep learning has also showed efficacy in healthcare. [161]

Mobile advertising
Finding the appropriate mobile audience for mobile advertising is always challenging, since many data points must be considered and assimilated before a target segment can be created and used in ad serving by any ad server. [162][163] Deep learning has been used to interpret large, many-dimensioned advertising datasets. Many data points are collected during the request/serve/click internet advertising cycle. This information can form the basis of machine learning to improve ad selection. Image restoration
Deep learning has been successfully applied to inverse problems such as denoising, super-resolution, inpainting, and film colorization. These applications include learning methods such as "Shrinkage Fields for Effective Image Restoration"[164] which trains on an image dataset, and Deep Image Prior, which trains on the image that needs restoration. Financial fraud detection
Deep learning is being successfully applied to financial fraud detection and anti-money laundering. "Deep anti-money laundering detection system can spot and recognize relationships and similarities between data and, further down the road, learn to detect anomalies or classify and predict specific events". The solution leverages both supervised learning techniques, such as the classification of suspicious transactions, and unsupervised learning, e.g. anomaly detection. [165]

The Department of Defense applied deep learning to train robots in new tasks through observation. [166]

Relation to human cognitive and brain development
Deep learning is closely related to a class of theories of brain development (specifically, neocortical development) proposed by cognitive neuroscientists in the early 1990s. [167][168][169][170] These developmental theories were instantiated in computational models, making them predecessors of deep learning systems. These developmental models share the property that various proposed learning dynamics in the brain (e.g., a wave of nerve growth factor) support the self-organization somewhat analogous to the neural networks utilized in deep learning models. Like the neocortex, neural networks employ a hierarchy of layered filters in which each layer considers information from a prior layer (or the operating environment), and then passes its output (and possibly the original input), to other layers. This process yields a self-organizing stack of transducers, well-tuned to their operating environment.
