[10] Women were first admitted to the university in 1884. [20]

A devastating fire in 1890 gutted the interior of University College and destroyed 33,000 volumes from the library,[21] but the university restored the building and replenished its library within two years. [21] Over the next two decades, a collegiate system took shape as the university arranged federation with several ecclesiastical colleges, including Strachan's Trinity College in 1904. The university operated the Royal Conservatory of Music from 1896 to 1991 and the Royal Ontario Museum from 1912 to 1968; both still retain close ties with the university as independent institutions. [22][23] The University of Toronto Press was founded in 1901 as Canada's first academic publishing house. [24] The Faculty of Forestry, founded in 1907 with Bernhard Fernow as dean, was Canada's first university faculty devoted to forest science. In 1910, the Faculty of Education opened its laboratory school, the University of Toronto Schools. The First and Second World Wars curtailed some university activities as undergraduate and graduate men eagerly enlisted. [25][26] Intercollegiate athletic competitions and the Hart House Debates were suspended, although exhibition and interfaculty games were still held. [26] The David Dunlap Observatory in Richmond Hill opened in 1935, followed by the University of Toronto Institute for Aerospace Studies in 1949. [10][27] The university opened satellite campuses in Scarborough in 1964 and in Mississauga in 1967. The university's former affiliated schools at the Ontario Agricultural College and Glendon Hall became fully independent of the University of Toronto and became part of University of Guelph in 1964 and York University in 1965, respectively. Beginning in the 1980s, reductions in government funding prompted more rigorous fundraising efforts. [10] The University of Toronto was the first Canadian university to amass a financial endowment greater than C$1 billion in 2007. [28]

Grounds

Soldiers' Tower, a memorial to alumni fallen in the World Wars, contains a 51-bell carillon. The university grounds lie about 2 kilometres (1.2 mi) north of the Financial District in Downtown Toronto and immediately south of the neighbourhoods of Yorkville and The Annex. The site encompasses 71 hectares (180 acres) bounded mostly by Bay Street to the east, Bloor Street to the north, Spadina Avenue to the west and College Street to the south. [4] An enclave surrounded by university grounds, Queen's Park, contains the Ontario Legislative Building and several historic monuments. With its green spaces and many interlocking courtyards, the university forms a distinct region of urban parkland in the city's downtown core. [29] The namesake University Avenue is a ceremonial boulevard and arterial thoroughfare that runs through downtown between Queen's Park and Front Street. The Spadina, St. George, Museum, and Queen's Park stations of the Toronto subway system are nearby. Stone pillars of the Bennett Gates mark the southern entrance of Philosopher's Walk. The architecture is epitomized by a combination of Romanesque and Gothic Revival buildings spread across the eastern and central portions of campus, most dating between 1858 and 1929.
