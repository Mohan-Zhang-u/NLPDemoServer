[56] Regis College, a Jesuit seminary, entered federation with the university in 1979. [57]

In contrast with the constituent colleges, the colleges of Knox, Massey, Regis, St. Michael's, Trinity, Victoria and Wycliffe continue to exist as legally distinct entities, each possessing a separate financial endowment. While St. Michael's, Trinity and Victoria continue to recognize their religious affiliations and heritage, they have since adopted secular policies of enrolment and teaching in non-divinity subjects. [55] Some colleges have, or once had, collegiate structures of their own: Emmanuel College is a college of Victoria and St. Hilda's College is part of Trinity;[50][58] St. Josephâ€™s College had existed as a college within St. Michael's until it was dissolved in 2006. [51] Ewart College existed as an affiliated college until 1991, when it was merged into Knox College. [59] Postgraduate theology degrees are conferred by the colleges of Knox, Regis and Wycliffe, along with the divinity faculties within Emmanuel, St. Michael's and Trinity, including joint degrees with the university through the Toronto School of Theology.

Academics

The Munk School of Global Affairs encompasses programs and research institutes for international relations. The Faculty of Arts and Science is the university's main undergraduate faculty, and administers most of the courses in the college system. [61] While the colleges are not entirely responsible for teaching duties, most of them house specialized academic programs and lecture series. Among other subjects, Trinity College is associated with programs in international relations, as are University College with Canadian studies, Victoria College with Renaissance studies, Innis College with film studies and urban studies, New College with gender studies, Woodsworth College with industrial relations and St. Michael's College with Medievalism. [62] The faculty teaches undergraduate commerce in collaboration with the Rotman School of Management. The Faculty of Applied Science and Engineering is the other major direct-entry undergraduate faculty. [63]

The University of Toronto is the birthplace of an influential school of thought on communication theory and literary criticism, known as the Toronto School. [64][65][66] Described as "the theory of the primacy of communication in the structuring of human cultures and the structuring of the human mind",[66] the school is rooted in the works of Eric A. Havelock and Harold Innis and the subsequent contributions of Edmund Snow Carpenter, Northrop Frye and Marshall McLuhan. Since 1963, the McLuhan Program in Culture and Technology of the Faculty of Information has carried the mandate for teaching and advancing the Toronto School. [67]


The Sandford Fleming Building contains offices of the Faculty of Applied Science and Engineering. Several notable works in arts and humanities are based at the university, including the Dictionary of Canadian Biography since 1959 and the Collected Works of Erasmus since 1969. [68][69] The Records of Early English Drama collects and edits the surviving documentary evidence of dramatic arts in pre-Puritan England,[70] while the Dictionary of Old English compiles the early vocabulary of the English language from the Anglo-Saxon period.
