[119][120] The AeroVelo Atlas, which was the first to win the Igor I. Sikorsky Human Powered Helicopter Competition in 2013, was developed by the university's team of students and graduates and was tested in Vaughan. The Donnelly Centre is part of the Discovery District, one of the world's largest biotechnology research clusters. The discovery of insulin at the University of Toronto in 1921 is considered among the most significant events in the history of medicine. [121][122] The stem cell was discovered at the university in 1963, forming the basis for bone marrow transplantation and all subsequent research on adult and embryonic stem cells. [123] This was the first of many findings at Toronto relating to stem cells, including the identification of pancreatic and retinal stem cells. [124][125] The cancer stem cell was first identified in 1997 by Toronto researchers,[126] who have since found stem cell associations in leukemia, brain tumors and colorectal cancer. [127][128] Medical inventions developed at Toronto include the glycaemic index,[129] the infant cereal Pablum,[130] the use of protective hypothermia in open heart surgery[131] and the first artificial cardiac pacemaker. [131] The first successful single-lung transplant was performed at Toronto in 1981, followed by the first nerve transplant in 1988,[132] and the first double-lung transplant in 1989. Researchers identified the maturation promoting factor that regulates cell division, and discovered the T-cell receptor, which triggers responses of the immune system. [133] The university is credited with isolating the genes that cause Fanconi anemia, cystic fibrosis and early-onset Alzheimer's disease, among numerous other diseases. [134] Between 1914 and 1972, the university operated the Connaught Medical Research Laboratories, now part of the pharmaceutical corporation Sanofi-Aventis. Among the research conducted at the laboratory was the development of gel electrophoresis. [135]

The University of Toronto is the primary research presence that supports one of the world's largest concentrations of biotechnology firms. [136] More than 5,000 principal investigators reside within 2 kilometres (1.2 mi) from the university grounds in Toronto's Discovery District, conducting $1 billion of medical research annually. [136] MaRS Discovery District is a research park that serves commercial enterprises and the university's technology transfer ventures. In 2008, the university disclosed 159 inventions and had 114 active start-up companies. [4] Its SciNet Consortium operates the most powerful supercomputer in Canada. [137]

Athletics
Main article: Toronto Varsity Blues
The 43 sports teams of the Varsity Blues represent the university in intercollegiate competitions. The two main leagues in which the Blues participate are U Sports (formerly known as Canadian Interuniversity Sport (CIS)) for national competitions and the auxiliary Ontario University Athletics conference at the provincial level. The athletic nickname of Varsity Blues was not consistently used until the 1930s; previously, references such as "Varsity", "The Big Blue", "The Blue and White" and "The Varsity Blue" also appeared interchangeably. [138] The Blue and White is commonly played and sung in athletic games as a fight song.
