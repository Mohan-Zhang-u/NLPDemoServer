The University of Toronto Rowing Club trains in Toronto Harbour for the 1924 Summer Olympics. The team won silver for Canada. North American (gridiron) football traces its very origin to the University of Toronto, with the first documented football game played at University College on November 9, 1861. [140][141] The Blues played their first intercollegiate football match in 1877 against the University of Michigan, in a game that ended with a scoreless draw. [138] Since intercollegiate seasons began in 1898, the Blues have won four Grey Cup, two Vanier Cup and 25 Yates Cup championships, including the inaugural championships for all three trophies. [138] However, the football team has hit a rough patch following its last championship in 1993. [142] From 2001 until 2008, the Blues suffered the longest losing streak in Canadian collegiate history, recording 49 consecutive winless games. [143] This was preceded by a single victory in 2001 that ended a run of 18 straight losses. [144] The site of Varsity Stadium has served as the primary playing grounds of the Varsity Blues football and soccer programs since 1898. [10] It also served as the venue for archery during the 2015 Pan American Games. Formed in 1891, the storied Varsity Blues men's ice hockey team has left many legacies on the national, professional and international hockey scenes. Conn Smythe played for the Blues as a centre during his undergraduate years, and was a Blues coach from 1923 to 1926. [145] When Smythe took over the Toronto Maple Leafs in 1927, his new team adopted the Varsity Blue's familiar blue-and-white sweater design. [145] Blues hockey competed at the 1928 Winter Olympics and captured the gold medal for Canada. [146] At the 1980 Winter Olympics, Blues coach Tom Watt served as co-coach of the Canadian hockey team in which six players were Varsity grads. [145] In all, the Blues have won the U Sports University Cup national hockey title ten times, last in 1984. Varsity Arena has been the permanent home of the Blues ice hockey programs since it opened in 1926. [10] In men's basketball, the Varsity Blues have won 14 conference titles, including the inaugural championship in 1909, but have not won a national title. [147] In swimming, the men's team has claimed the national crown 16 times since 1964, while the women's team has claimed the crown 14 times since 1970. [148] Established in 1897, the University of Toronto Rowing Club is Canada's oldest collegiate rowing club. [149] It earned a silver medal for the country in the 1924 Summer Olympics, finishing second to Yale's crew. [149]
