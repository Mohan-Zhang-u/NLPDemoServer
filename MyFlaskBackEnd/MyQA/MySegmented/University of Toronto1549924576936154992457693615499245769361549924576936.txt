Governance and colleges

Old Vic, the main building of Victoria College, typifies the Richardsonian Romanesque style. The University of Toronto has traditionally been a decentralized institution, with governing authority shared among its central administration, academic faculties and colleges. [44] The Governing Council is the unicameral legislative organ of the central administration, overseeing general academic, business and institutional affairs. [45] Before 1971, the university was governed under a bicameral system composed of the board of governors and the university senate. [44] The chancellor, usually a former governor general, lieutenant governor, premier or diplomat, is the ceremonial head of the university. The president is appointed by the council as the chief executive. [45]

Unlike most North American institutions, the University of Toronto is a collegiate university with a model that resembles those of the University of Cambridge and the University of Oxford in Britain. [46] The colleges hold substantial autonomy over admissions, scholarships, programs and other academic and financial affairs, in addition to the housing and social duties of typical residential colleges. [45][46] The system emerged in the 19th century, as ecclesiastical colleges considered various forms of union with the University of Toronto to ensure their viability. The desire to preserve religious traditions in a secular institution resulted in the federative collegiate model that came to characterize the university. [46]


The Chapel of Trinity College reflects the college's Anglican heritage. University College was the founding nondenominational college, created in 1853 after the university was secularized. Knox College, a Presbyterian institution, and Wycliffe College, a low church seminary, both encouraged their students to study for non-divinity degrees at University College. [47] In 1885, they entered a formal affiliation with the University of Toronto, and became federated schools in 1890. [34][48] The idea of federation initially met strong opposition at Victoria University, a Methodist school in Cobourg, but a financial incentive in 1890 convinced the school to join. [49] Decades after the death of John Strachan, the Anglican seminary Trinity College entered federation in 1904,[50] followed in 1910 by St. Michael's College, a Roman Catholic college founded by the Basilian Fathers. [51] Among the institutions that had considered federation but ultimately remained independent were McMaster University, a Baptist school that later moved to Hamilton,[47] and Queen's College, a Presbyterian school in Kingston that later became Queen's University.

The post-war era saw the creation of New College in 1962, Innis College in 1964 and Woodsworth College in 1974, all of them nondenominational. [53] Along with University College, they comprise the university's constituent colleges, which are established and funded by the central administration and are therefore financially dependent. [54][55] Massey College was established in 1963 by the Massey Foundation as a college exclusively for graduate students.
