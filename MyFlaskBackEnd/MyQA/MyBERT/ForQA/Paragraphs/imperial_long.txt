Upstream recorded a net loss in the second quarter of $6 million compared to a net loss of $201 million in the same period of 2017. Improved results reflect the impact of higher Canadian crude oil realizations of about $280 million, partially offset by higher royalty costs of about $50 million and higher operating expenses of about $50 million mainly associated with planned turnarounds.

The company's share of gross production from Syncrude averaged 50,000 barrels per day, up from 27,000 barrels per day in the second quarter of 2017. Higher production was due to the absence of the Syncrude Mildred Lake upgrader fire that occurred in March 2017, partially offset by planned turnaround activities and a power disruption that occurred on June 20, 2018, resulting in a complete shutdown of all processing units for the remainder of the second quarter. Recovery from the power outage is ongoing with partial production restored in July and return to full rates anticipated in September. 

Downstream net income was $201 million in the second quarter, up from $78 million in the second quarter of 2017.
