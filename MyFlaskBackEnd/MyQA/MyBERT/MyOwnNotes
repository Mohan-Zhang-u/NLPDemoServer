As listed in the context, it is a pretraining to understand the model.
it uses ULMFiT, the one presented in the second Research friday.

Predict next sentence, to make sense of context (and the meaning of the corpus)

see my_run_classifier.py. dev set is where eval is performed




code to check in MrpcProcessor(DataProcessor), since processor = processors[task_name]()
label_list = processor.get_labels(), so we will change it, that we dont use labels, we just directly output the result.

 if FLAGS.do_eval:
   !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! test.tsv never used (different datafile has different path)
 train_examples=$GLUE_DIR/MRPC/train.tsv
 eval_examples=$GLUE_DIR/MRPC/dev.tsv
 eval_file=tmp/mrpc_output/eval.tf_record
 train_file=tmp/mrpc_output/train.tf_record
 in MRPC, quality 1 means same, 0 means not?


 eval_input_fn = file_based_input_fn_builder(
        input_file=eval_file,
        seq_length=FLAGS.max_seq_length(i dont care here),
        is_training=False,
        drop_remainder=eval_drop_remainder(false))

    result = estimator.evaluate(input_fn=eval_input_fn, steps=eval_steps)

 severely, read https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/estimators


 need filed_based_convert_examples_to_features(
        eval_examples, label_list, FLAGS.max_seq_length, tokenizer, eval_file) to convert file to tf_record file.



  So, what do we need to feed in predict?
  class_ids contains a list.
